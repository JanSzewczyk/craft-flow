## 👋 What is CraftFlow?

**Problem:** Craftsmen (carpenters, plumbers, finishers) waste time answering client questions ("What stage is my order
at?"). Documents, contracts, and job-site photos are scattered across SMS messages, emails, and chat apps.

**Solution:** CraftFlow is a simple B2B2C SaaS platform that lets a craftsman create a **project timeline** and share it
with a client via a single link. The client sees real-time progress, while the contractor manages all their jobs in one
place.

**Growth model (PLG):** Clients receive the link as Guests but are encouraged to create a free account to save their
renovation history forever. By signing up, they enter the CraftFlow ecosystem — becoming a free marketing channel.

## ✨ Product

### 🧑‍🔧 Contractor Zone (`/app/*`)

- **📋 Project Management** — Paginated job list, create new projects, and assign them to clients
- **🗓️ Project Timeline** — Add execution stages, mark them as complete, and track progress
- **📁 Files & Attachments** — Upload contracts (PDF) and photos (JPEG/PNG/WEBP); Supabase Storage serves optimized
  thumbnails
- **📄 Templates (`/app/templates`)** — Project "recipes" (e.g. "Window Installation") copied via Deep Copy — template
  changes don't affect existing projects
- **👥 Client CRM (`/app/clients`)** — Contact database; relational protection prevents deleting clients with active
  projects
- **🎨 Branding (`/app/branding`)** — Customize logo, primary color, and default email message shown in the client
  portal
- **🌙 Light & Dark Theme** — System-wide light/dark/system theme switching available across all views

### 👁️ Client View & PLG Mechanics

- **🔗 Guest View (`/status/[publicToken]`)** — Clean, read-only project view with contractor branding; a Data Mock
  Object (DMO) protects internal notes from unauthorized access
- **🚪 Authwall (PLG)** — A prompt on the timeline encouraging clients to sign up to "save their renovation history
  forever"
- **✨ Account Auto-Linking** — When a client signs up, the server searches their email across all CRM databases and
  links historical projects to their global Clerk ID
- **🖥️ Client Portal (`/client/*`)** — Registered client dashboard with active jobs and history views

### 💳 Subscriptions & Limits (Clerk Billing)

B2B subscription model with a 14-day trial:

| Plan         | Active Projects | Templates | Branding    |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **Basic**    | 5               | 2         | Locked      |
| **Standard** | 20              | 10        | ✅ Unlocked |
| **Premium**  | Unlimited       | Unlimited | ✅ Unlocked |

### 🏗️ Onboarding & Authorization

- **Role-based Registration** — Sign-up form assigns `publicMetadata.roles: ["contractor"]` in Clerk
- **Plan Selection** — Clerk Billing plan selection is enforced before entering the dashboard
- **Stepper State Persistence** — Onboarding progress is saved to the database, preventing data loss on refresh
- **Middleware Protection** — Middleware blocks `/app/*` for users without `onboardingComplete: true` and an active plan

### 🔐 Admin Panel

Available only after assigning the `admin` role in Clerk:

- KPI overview: number of active contractors, MRR, PLG growth
- Ability to ban a contractor account and provide technical support (Impersonate)

## 🧪 Testing

CraftFlow has a three-layer testing infrastructure.

### 🔬 Unit Tests (Vitest — Node environment)

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Unit tests live in `tests/unit/` using the `*.test.ts` pattern. Run a single file:

```bash
npx vitest run --project=unit path/to/file.test.ts
```

### 🧩 Component Tests (Vitest + Storybook — Playwright/Chromium)

```bash
npm run test:storybook
```

Storybook interaction tests run in a real Chromium browser via `@vitest/browser-playwright`. Stories use CSF Next format
with the `.test()` method:

```typescript
const meta = preview.meta({
  title: "Features/...",
  component: MyComponent,
  args: { requiredProp: defaultBuilder.one() } // required props as default meta args
});
export const Default = meta.story({});
Default.test("renders correctly", async ({ canvas }) => { ... });
```

Run a single story file:

```bash
npx vitest run --project=storybook path/to/component.stories.tsx
```

### 🎭 End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

Build the app first, then run the tests:

```bash
npm run build && npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright UI mode for debugging:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## 🎨 Styling & Design System

CraftFlow uses **[Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)** with a CSS-first configuration and the
**[Szum-Tech Design System](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@szum-tech/design-system)**, which provides:

- ✅ Ready-made components built on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
- 🎨 OKLCH semantic color tokens and design tokens
- 🌙 Light, dark, and system theme switching via [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) — applies
  across all views including the client portal
- 📖 [Component documentation](https://szum-tech-design-system.vercel.app/?path=/docs/components--docs)

### Usage

```typescript
import { Button, Card, Tooltip } from "@szum-tech/design-system";
```

Icons are provided via `lucide-react` (re-exported through the design system). Use `startIcon`/`endIcon` props on
`Button` — not children.

---

## 💻 Environment Variables

[T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/) provides build-time validation of environment variables.

### Configuration Files

- **`data/env/server.ts`** — Server-only variables (CLERK_SECRET_KEY, RESEND_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_URL,
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, LOG_LEVEL, etc.)
- **`data/env/client.ts`** — Client-safe variables (must use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)

### Benefits

- ✅ Fully typed access across the entire codebase
- ✅ Build-time validation — missing variables fail fast
- ✅ Empty strings treated as `undefined`
- ✅ Skip validation in Docker builds with `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=true`

---

## 📝 Logging

CraftFlow uses **[Pino](https://getpino.io/)** for structured JSON logging.

### Usage

```typescript
import logger, { createLogger } from "~/lib/logger";

const moduleLogger = createLogger({ module: "projects-service" });
moduleLogger.info({ userId, projectId }, "Project created successfully");
moduleLogger.error({ userId, operation: "createProject", errorCode: err.code }, "DB insert failed");
```

### Log Levels

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=fatal   # Fatal errors only
LOG_LEVEL=error   # Errors and above
LOG_LEVEL=warn    # Warnings and above
LOG_LEVEL=info    # Info and above (default)
LOG_LEVEL=debug   # Debug messages and above
LOG_LEVEL=trace   # Everything
```

### Built-in Logging

- **Request logging** — `proxy.ts` logs method, URL, status, and response time with a unique `X-Request-ID` header
- **Health check** — `app/api/health/route.ts` logs at info/debug/error levels
- **Error handlers** — `app/error.tsx` and `app/global-error.tsx` capture and log page and application errors

---

## 🚀 GitHub Actions

### Available Workflows

#### 1. ✅ PR Check (`pr-check.yml`)

Runs on every pull request with the following jobs:

- 🏗️ **Build** — Verifies the project builds successfully
- 🧹 **Prettier** — Code formatting check
- ⬣ **ESLint** — Code quality and linting
- 🛠️ **TypeScript** — Type checking
- ♻️ **Prewarm Playwright Cache** — Installs Chromium once before the test matrix to prevent cache-save race conditions
- 🧪 **Test `<feature>` (matrix)** — **10 parallel jobs**, one per feature domain (`auth`, `billing`, `contact`,
  `contractor`, `crm`, `marketing`, `onboarding`, `projects`, `templates`, `misc`). Each job runs both unit
  (`*.test.ts`) and Storybook (`*.stories.tsx`) tests for its domain in a single Vitest pass using the
  [blob reporter](https://vitest.dev/guide/improving-performance#sharding) to produce a coverage shard.
- 📊 **Coverage Report** — Merges all 10 blob shards with `vitest run --merge-reports`, generates a unified coverage
  summary, and posts it as a PR comment via
  [vitest-coverage-report-action](https://github.com/davelosert/vitest-coverage-report-action).
- 🎭 **Playwright E2E** — Full end-to-end test suite (Chromium + Firefox + WebKit)

The matrix strategy uses `fail-fast: false` so a failure in one domain does not cancel the remaining nine jobs — all
domains always finish and the coverage report is always generated.

#### 2. 🤖 AI Code Review (`code-review.yml`)

Automated code review on every PR via OpenAI (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret).

#### 3. 🚢 Publish (`publish.yml`)

Triggered on merge to `main`:

- 📦 Determines next version via [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) +
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- 📝 Updates `CHANGELOG.md`
- 🏷️ Creates a GitHub release
- 🔢 Bumps version in `package.json`

---

## 🔒 Server-only Code

The [`server-only`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only) package prevents server code from leaking into the client
bundle:

```typescript
import "server-only";

export async function getSecretData() {
  // Build-time error if imported by a Client Component
}
```

The `lib/supabase/db.ts` database client uses `server-only` — it will never reach the browser.
